# navi-cheats

My personal cheatsheets for [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi).

## Installation

Import the cheatsheets into navi:

```bash
navi repo add serpro69/navi-cheats
```

Then you can use the new cheatsheets as normal with navi. See [navi usage](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) for more detauls.
